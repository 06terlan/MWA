1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout.

setTimeout schedules a callback to run after a specific time, the function registered in the 
time phase of the event loop. But setImmediate will schedule a callback to run at check phase
of the event loop after IO events callback. That means setTimout callbacks are called first because
time phase is top of the event loop.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?

setImmediate adds callback to check phase of event loop after IO events. But process.nextTick adds callbacks to
the nextTick queue which is not part of the event loop. And nextTick more prior. That means all the callback
will be called then event loop can go throught its phases.
